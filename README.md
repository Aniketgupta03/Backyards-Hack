This project calculates AQI based on chemical pollutant quantity using machine learning. AQI: The air quality index is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis. In other words, it is a measure of how air pollution affects oneâ€™s health within a short time period. The AQI is calculated based on the average concentration of a particular pollutant measured over a standard time interval. Generally, the time interval is 24 hours for most pollutants, 8 hours for carbon monoxide and ozone.
